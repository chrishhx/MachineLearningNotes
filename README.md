# MachineLearningNotes
Notes and demos codes for machine learning algorithms.

### Basically Done
may add more contents or edit the existing files

Support Vector Machine
> Include derivation of hard margin svm ,soft margin svm , SMO algorithm , kernel methods and a simple demo. I might add more demos in the future.

Generalized Linear Models
> Models that base on linear operator $x^T \theta$
> 1. Linear regression
> 2. Logistic regression
> 3. Generalized linear models
> 4. Constrained linear models ( Ridge regression / LASSO / ElasticNet )

k Nearest Neighbors
> kNN is a simple but effective algorithm. The main challenge is how to find the k Nearest Neighbors quickly. KD-tree and Ball-tree are usually used . Links to them are in the note.

Decision Tree
> Introduce the framework of decision tree and 3 classic criterion corresponding to ID3,C4.5,CART


### In Progress

Ensemble-Method
> Ensembles of models are powerful and efficient. Working on it.
> By the way , Ensemble Method is my major research area.

Neural Networks
> just configurate develop environment. Cuda / cudnn / tensorflow-gpu
> may not update recently.

### In Plan

Dimension Reduction

Clustering

Graphical Model

Reinforce Learning
